This is the sketch code for an Arduino Mega 2560 to play "Take No Prisoners" by Megadeth.

There's a video of it in action here: http://youtu.be/gb7QKcmypus

Also included is the enhanced Tone library and a modified version of the standard Servo library, modified to allow use of all six timers.

The machine consists of four servos, two solenoids, a cell phone vibration motor, three speakers, and a SeeedStudio Motor Shield.
